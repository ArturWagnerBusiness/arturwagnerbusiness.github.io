      I made one video about Python I guess. That is the only one related to
      programming I guess...

      Python is a great language, I stumbled onto some typical errors that I
      decided to share solutions to. I myself needed to spend days trying to
      figure out how to solve some of them so decided to put all the solution
      into a single short video with time stamps.
