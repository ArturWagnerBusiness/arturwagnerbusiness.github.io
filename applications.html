      (<a href="https://github.com/ArturWagnerBusiness/DiscordBot">Source</a>)
      <br />
      A discord bot written in TypeScript to be run with Node.
      Have not run it since 2021 so it is possibly broken but updating it 
      should not be a hassle as the discord package should not change as ofter... I think...

        <li>Allows send images</li>
        <li>Allows a detailed config file for high customization!</li>
        <li>Displays system information</li>

      <br />
      Back in the day when I learned Python, I always wanted to have an editors
      that I saw linux users use. Now I know they were Vim and Nano but at the time
      I did not. Knowing this I wanted to remake them with Python. This was my attempt at this.
