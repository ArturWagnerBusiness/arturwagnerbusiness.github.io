      <a> Discord Bot [2021]</a>
      (<a href="https://github.com/ArturWagnerBusiness/DiscordBot">Source</a>)
      <br />
      A discord bot written in TypeScript to be run with Node. I Have not run it
      since 2021, so it is possibly broken, but updating it should not be a
      hassle as the Discord package should not change as ofter... I think...
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Allows playing music.</li>
      <li>Allows send images.</li>
      <li>Allows a detailed config file for high customization!</li>
      <li>Displays system information.</li>
    </ul>

      <a> Python Terminal File Editor [2019] </a>
      (<a href="https://github.com/ArturWagnerBusiness/CMD">Source</a>)
      <br />
      Back in the day when I learned Python, I always wanted to have an editor.
      that I saw Linux users use. Now I know they were Vim and Nano, but at the
      time I did not. Knowing this, I wanted to remake them with Python. This
      was my attempt at this.
    </p>

      <li>Allows for save/load.</li>
      <li>Has themes!</li>
    </ul>

      Anything I did during my GCSE's and a bit afterwards can be found here.
      Not all, of course, because most of it got lost in between system resets
      and USB wipes...

    <ul>
      <li>Mix of Python, JS, Java and others.</li>
      <li>Some client - server code</li>
