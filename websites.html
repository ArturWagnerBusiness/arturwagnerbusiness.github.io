      My most recent one is made using react with typescript. There are some
      other libraries to make some cool effects but that is mainly it.

      <a>University Final Year Project [2022]</a>
      (<a href="https://github.com/ArturWagnerBusiness/FYP_21-22/">Source</a>)
      <br />
      A platform that allowed the user to generate their own content
      (programming exercises) was developed during my final year at Kingston
      University. The execution was handled by NoobLab system already existing
      at the university.<br />
      Project-oriented with allowing the university to gain a permanent source
      of new exercises from past students, that would be provided to the
      new/future students.<br />
      The main system features developed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>React with Material UI Front-End</li>
      <li>Express Back-end Server</li>
      <li>Email based login system (no passwords! only live tokens!)</li>
      <li>MySQL Database</li>
      <li>Students can create exercises</li>
      <li>
        Students can run exercises through
        <a href="https://www.nooblab.com/nooblab/">NoobLab</a>
      </li>
      <li>Students can query exercises</li>
      <li>Students can rate exercises</li>
    </ul>

      A website packed with everything that I deemed fancy and good looking.
      Many libraries and requires compiling every time...

      This website I designed first in Figma, which is a great design tool to
      create layouts. Once I knew how I wanted to website to look like I was
      then able to go straight into the development process. At the time I
      really wanted to add fancy navigation bar so I used a css property skew to
      bend the rectangles into these polygons. <br />There is also a Theme
      changer at the top side. The website only has 2 games and 2 musics I
      developed at the time.

      This is the first full website I ever tried to create. Because at the time
      I did not know how to design I decided to copy a different website called
      <a href="https://www.mikufan.com/">mikufan.com</a>. The design was copied
      only using eyes, as it would be pointless experience if I copied any real
      code or css, right?
