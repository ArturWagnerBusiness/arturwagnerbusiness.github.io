      Hi, I am Artur, a <em>developer</em> and <em>Linux enjoyer</em>
    </h1>

    <h3>Why is this website so simple?</h3>
    <p>
      I went through many iterations over the years and I think this is the best
      design. At the time I been reading about the
      <strong>KISS Principle</strong> which stands for "Keep It Simple Stupid".
      This meaning that if I need a place to store my portfolio, I don't need a
      3d metaverse AI based website with complex API backend. Simple html file
      does the job and does it well. It is also a lot more robust and
      maintainable!
