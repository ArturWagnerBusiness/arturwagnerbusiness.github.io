      Hi, I am Artur, a <em>Developer</em> and <em>Linux</em> user
    </h1>
    <p><em>- Developer's job is to turn dreams into reality.</em></p>
    <h3>Why is this website so simple?</h3>
    <p>
      I went through many iterations over the years and I think this is the best
      design. At the time I had been reading about the
      <strong>KISS Principle</strong> which stands for "Keep It Simple Stupid".
      This means that if I need a place to store my portfolio, I don't need a 3d
      metaverse AI based website with complex API backend. A simple HTML file
      does the job and does it well. It is also a lot more robust and
      maintainable!
