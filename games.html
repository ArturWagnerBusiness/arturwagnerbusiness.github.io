    <h1>(<a href="index.html">Return</a>) My Games!</h1>
    <p>
      In between 2019 and 2020 I developed 2 small games which are playable in a
      browser. In 2024 I took my first ever Game Jam... and in 2025 my second...

      A game prototype developer for a Game Jam called
      <a href="https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-198-speed">Mini Jam 198: Speed</a>.
      A <strong>72 hour</strong> Jam was announced with a theme Speed. Once the
      limitation of "there is no end" was displayed, I got the idea for the
      game. This jam I tackled with an entirely different approach of first
      outlaying the entire gameplay in text, then scetch every screen and all
      gameplay elements. Surprisingly, although obvious at first glance,
      creating art, audio and code was a lot simpler then in my first jam or any
      project in that matter. I also got (most) features planned into the game.
      (Did not have time to put Jimmy in. Sorry Jimmy)

      The main principle is the same as minesweeper. Numbers show the total of
      mines around the tile. The difference is that mines can have a value of
      more than 1. You can place numbered flags for assistance or destroy the
      flag with the mine underneath. The mines are shown at the top. Get them
      all to 0 and uncover all of the land. Aim for 0 hits if possible!

      A game prototype developed for a Game Jam called
      <a href="https://itch.io/jam/mini-jame-gam-31">Mini Jame Gam #31</a>. I
      decided to take part in this <strong>59 hour</strong> Jam to see how well
      I could handle game development under strict time scales. Surprisingly I
      was able to finish the game a few hours before the deadline! Got in with
      no Godot knowledge but came out all and well.

      Explore the dark labyrinth, find keys and escape. Simple? Well, the issue
      is your light course is slowly fading... You need to recharge it... but to
      do so you need to go into the deep dark. Darkness in itself is not
      scary... but are you sure you are alone?

      In a fictional world of [redacted] you play as [redacted] to fight the
      [redacted]. The ways increase as you continue getting stronger. However,
      everyone has their limits, right?
