    <h1>(<a href="index.html">Return</a>) My Games!</h1>
    <p>
      In between 2019 and 2020 I developed 2 small games which are playable in a
      browser. In 2024 I took my first ever Game Jam
    </p>

      <a>Hex MineSweeper [2024]</a>

      The main principle is same as minesweeper. Numbers show the total of mines
      around the tile. The difference is that mines can have a value of more
      then 1. You can place numbered flags for assistance or destroy the flag
      with the mine underneath. The mines are show at the top. Get them all to 0
      and uncover all of the land. Aim for 0 hits if possible!

      <a>Wizy: The Time Wizard [2024]</a>
      (<a href="https://itch.io/jam/mini-jame-gam-31/rate/2762737">Jam Entry</a

      A game prototype developer for a Game Jam called
      <a href="https://itch.io/jam/mini-jame-gam-31">Mini Jame Gam #31</a>. I
      decided to take part in this <strong>59 hour</strong> Jam to see how well
      I could handle game development under strick time scales. Surprisingly I
      was able to finish the game few hours before the deadline! Got in with no
      Godot knowledge but came out all and well.

      Explore the dark labyrinth, find keys and escape. Simple? Well, the issue
      is your light course is slowly fading... You need to recharge it... but to
      do so you need to go into the deep dark. Darkness in itself is not
      scary... but are you sure you are alone?

      In a fictional word of [redacted] you play as [redacted] to fight the
      [redacted]. The ways increase as you continue getting stronger. However,
      everyone has their limits right?
